make it full stack CRUD app.
- First-level comments should be ordered by their score, whereas nested replies are ordered by time added.
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Adding a new comment or reply uses the `currentUser` object from within the `data.json` file.
- Replying to a comment adds the new reply to the bottom of the nested replies within that comment.






### Expected behaviour

- A confirmation modal should pop up before a comment or reply is deleted.
- You can only edit or delete your own comments and replies.
- Upvote and downvote comments
